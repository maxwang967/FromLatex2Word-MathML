** Attention: The release version is not always up-to-date, please run the source code for latest experience. **

## Brief Intro

The official Microsoft Word does not support specific Latex grammars, which is the obstacle for users to correctly include the latex equations in the Word document file.
Therefore, I develop a simple converter to convert the latex codes (text & equations & other latex codes) to mathml codes which can directly pasted into the Word document as an editable equation.
This GUI is built based on PyQT6, which can support multi-platform including MacOS, Linux and Windows.

## Running with the source code

First, you need to have a Python environment and install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the GUI with:
```bash
python eq_converter_v1.py
```

## Running with the binary

Please refer to release section for MacOS executable binary file.


# At last

Please free to create issues or contact me with the email for bugs or feature requests, which I may also continue to develop according to my personal requirements.
